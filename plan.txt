Things to do:

-Make tabs work for loaded content
-Make functions to change: font colour, background colour, font size, font?, toolbar appearance?
-Make the style function work: Maybe make a style object and stash it in local storage, loading with a default if it is not there.
 a bit like this:settings = {background: "black", fontColour:"white", fontSize:"9pt"}
-Find better font
-Find better way to save files, maybe look into JQUERY UI dialouge forms.
-toggle spell check? no idea where to start
-figure out how to have comments and other statements stylized to show keywords (while, for etc)
-Ask for confirmation when exiting, prevents work being lost
-Test for scaling
-make git hub for project
-make logo
-FIND A NAME!!
-print functionality
-make a function that generates a toolbar based on an object, this will make it easier to expand in the future
-Make documentation that explains how to add stuff to it, such as how to add to the toolbar generation function and how to add to the style defaults and such.
-Show to friends and ask them to get on board, ask them to test.
-Ask katie for style tips.
